# Falling
## A simple falling sand physics project
![Demo Project]("Demo" Demo.mp4)
This project was developed in C++ using the SDL2 Library for the Graphics.
It works by mouse inputs, when you click on the screen it starts creating sand while you move the mouse, which has a physics like behaviour. Every time you release the mouse button and presses it again the sand will have a different color!
